# UniversalEMU
This is an open-souure project where we,
want to create an emulator on pc that supports a lot of ROMS.
Our goal is to create an emulator that opens every ROM file.
Upload your changes to the pull requests and if it is accepted,
I will upload your code to the reporisitory.
(By the way I am testing this emulator with : The Legend of Zelda a Link to the Past)
